    <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
    <div class="container">
      
      <p> Muhammad Ali, original name Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., (born January 17, 1942, Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.—died June 3, 2016, Scottsdale, Arizona), American professional boxer and social activist. Ali was the first fighter to win the world heavyweight championship on three separate occasions; he successfully defended this title 19 times.Ali’s place in boxing history as one of the greatest fighters ever is secure. His final record of 56 wins and 5 losses with 37 knockouts has been matched by others, but the quality of his opponents and the manner in which he dominated during his prime placed him on a plateau with boxing’s immortals. Ali’s most-tangible ring assets were speed, superb footwork, and the ability to take a punch. But perhaps more important, he had courage and all the other intangibles that go into making a great fighter.</p>

        <p> In his best years, his technique was not mediocre, it was his personal body as superior as a fighting machine. He had to keep expanding his repertoire with age, and a year after that year was cut short, he had to choose from the best songs of his previously released album for his next collection. He used the reduced functionality of his body to get better at fighting technique. The things he was able to accomplish were considerable. </p>

        <p> When Cassius Clay was a boxer, he was practicing in the pool, discussing his upcoming shoot for Sports Illustrated. he explained to the photographer that his previous trainer had advised him to exercise to use the pool’s resistance to get stronger because it helps in carrying his body weight Perhaps some of the most impressive photos of Ali in action as a boxer are Schulke’s pictures of him standing in a pool. </p>

        <p> Tournament boxing- experts are surprised when Cassius Clay, a fighter in his mid-twenties, knocks out a reigning world heavyweight champion, age, in a seventh-round KO on February 25, 1964. During the Ali’s heavyweight championship battle with Sonny Liston, he tells Sonny to get back on his feet to the count of three before he gets knocked out by Liston. </p>

        <p> One of the most celebrated magazine front covers of all time and understandably so. Carl Fischer’s shot for Esquire was the brainchild of art director George Lois. The reference to St Sebastian speaks of Ali’s persecution following his refusal to fight in the Vietnam war. </p>

        <p> Muhammad Ali was never shy about lauding his own balletic talents in the boxing ring, and this photograph shows why. His ability to move away from his opponent, Joe Frazier, with such grace makes Frazier’s haymaker look utterly crude. Ali appears to be untouchable. How ironic, then, that Frazier won the contest that was dubbed Fight of The Century. </p>

        <p> This photograph was taken ahead of the world title fight in 1971. Frazier is steadfastly trying to ignore his bitter rival but in fact you wonder if he’s imprisoned by Ali’s taunts – a feeling that’s reinforced by the wire meshing which separates the two men.  </p>

        <p>Ali arrived at the Armed Forces Induction Center at 8:00 AM on April 28, 1967
          The Vietnam War was raging; many American soldiers were dying by the hundreds as anti-war demonstrators left for Canada. Ali wanted to go to Canada, but also wanted to avoid the draft.
          Two years ago, he said that his conscience wouldn’t allow him to kill darker people or hungry people. And what use? I wasn’t ever named “nigger,”, “raped,” or “murdered,”; they didn’t kennel me; and they didn’t take away my nationality, either. Will you dare? How can I run them over? “No problem.” It is in the context of my Muslim faith and personal beliefs that I state my refusal to be drafted.” I can’t be faithful to my religion by answering such a call. Allah is the only one who can judge the merits of my personal decisions.
          Later that day, Ali’s license was revoked. </p>

               <p> Shortly after having retired from boxing in 1984, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson’s syndrome, believed to be due to the extensive head injuries he had sustained throughout his career. Formerly, the champion’s motor abilities gradually diminished and his movement and communication became more limited. Although the disease stole his ability to move, Ali was able to continue to appear in the public eye to support humanitarian efforts, philanthropic, and goodwill projects, no matter. Saddehrun went to meet with the leaders of Iraq (in 1937) and helped to negotiate the release of American hostages in 2002, and he became a UN Messenger of Peace in the country of Afghanistan in the mid-1990s. His induction into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990 as “Fighter of the Year” resulted in a variety of Ring Magazine Awards, so “multiple winner” is most accurate of the phrases to use in this case. He’s been married four times, and has the aforementioned seven children and several daughters. The fourteenth year of his marriage, in 1986, he married Yolanda. Ali died on June 3, 2016, at the age of 74.</p>
